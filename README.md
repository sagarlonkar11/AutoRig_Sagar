# AutoRig_Sagar
Biped AutoRig
This is just an attempt to built a biped procedural way.

I will be honest, I have tried to understand different setups to create this one.

Two things pre-made stored in folders outside the code folder is Joint system and Models

Once we have those matching, we do a simple import of few modules.

Have created the following Modules:
‘ Base Modules ‘ which has controls and Main rig structure

‘ Rig modules ‘ which creates Limbs Spine and other body parts

‘ Utilities Module’ has joint properties which we use often


REPORT THIS AD

Modules such as ‘legs’ and ‘hands’ can be reused by adding suffix ‘right_’ or ‘left’.

‘HeadParts’ will have eyes tongue and hair attached.

With some basics it is good to have __init__ in each module to make it readable

Please contact me if you like to review the code

PS: I am currently doing IK_FK_Switch and spaceSwitch Module for the character to have more control
