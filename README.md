# AutoRig_Sagar
PROCEDURALISED AUTORIG (WIP)

This is my first attempt to built a biped rig in procedural way.

I will be honest, this is me trying to understand the background process.

To start with we have a skeleton and a model placed outsied in a folder matching eachother.

Once we have those matching, we do a simple import of few modules.

Have created the following Modules:
‘ Base Modules ‘ which has controls and Main rig structure

‘ Rig modules ‘ which creates Limbs Spine and other body parts

‘ Utilities Module’ has joint properties which we use often


REPORT THIS AD

Modules such as ‘legs’ and ‘hands’ can be reused by adding suffix ‘right_’ or ‘left’.

‘HeadParts’ will have eyes tongue and hair attached.

With some basics it is good to have __init__ in each module to make it readable

Please contact me if you like to review the code

PS: I am currently doing IK_FK_Switch and spaceSwitch Module for the character to have more control
